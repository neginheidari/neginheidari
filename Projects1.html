        <h1>Apply now!</h1>
        <p class="p1">
            Most undergraduate students apply through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS).
If you wish to study part-time, you apply to the university directly.
 Students from outside the UK can also apply this way.
            For entry onto courses starting from September 2022, we are offering special
             consideration to applications from care leavers of 16 UCAS points, equivalent to 2 A Level grades,
              lower than the advertised entry tariff for all undergraduate programmes on our website (including 
              those provided by our partner college franchise). For further information, 
            eligibility criteria and how to apply please click here.</p>

        <p class="p2">TIPS: <br> Here we guide you through
                 the application process, explain the 
                 entry requirements and other important 
                 things that you need to know when applying
                  to our courses and programmes. Common questions
                   and answers can be found in our 'FAQ and contact'
                 at the bottom of this page. Referral agents who provide 
                 advice and assistance to students wishing to study at 
                 Birmingham City University must apply to be a Registered Agent.
